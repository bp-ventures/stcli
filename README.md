# stcli

stcli - a repl command line crypto wallet for stellar that is simple and all in oneÂ python file

## Getting Started

If you have the Ubuntu you may be able to just clone the one file stcli.py. Everything resides in the one file... it will generate an stcli.conf in the same
directory or an encrypted stcli.zip.

The reason for this tiny app is I wanted a stellar wallet:

- written in python
- 100% auditable
- usable from a secured server
- for testing deposits and withdrawals
- fully command line text based
- keep on a USB key and run under tails
- multisig that can be used on a read only linux box

THIS APP IS MADE FOR TESTING PURPOSES AUTHORS TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE
